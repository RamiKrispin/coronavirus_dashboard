A few days ago, while looking at examples of COVID-19 data visualization at the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center website, I came across the following plot on the [mortality analysis page](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality):



The plot represents the ratio between death and confirmed cases by country, and it has two modes (controlled by the buttons on the top left):

* Observed case-fatality ratio - death to confirmed cases ratio in percentage by country 
* Death per 100,000 population - the death rate per 100,000 population by country

The plot's axes are log scaled, and the diagonal lines represent the death range by percentage or number of people per 100,000 population, respectively. I liked the idea of adding the diagonal lines to represent a linear range, so I decided to try to reproduce it with Plotly.
